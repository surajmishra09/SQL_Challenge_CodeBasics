# SQL_Challenge

"I presented insights to management by executing SQL queries, and then created a visually appealing presentation using MS Word to effectively convey the insights.


# Dataset
This Dataset are provided by codebasics. Overview of the tables found in the 'gdb023' (atliq_hardware_db) database. It includes information for six main tables:

1. dim_customer: contains customer-related data
2. dim_product: contains product-related data
3. fact_gross_price: contains gross price information for each product
4. fact_manufacturing_cost: contains the cost incurred in the production of each product
5. fact_pre_invoice_deductions: contains pre-invoice deductions information for each product
6. fact_sales_monthly: contains monthly sales data for each product.


# Some of the learnings from this project:
1.    How to write complicated SQL Queries using multiple CTE’s, joins on more than one column, Windows functions ,subqueries, Union , etc. to get insights from business point of view.
2.    How to format the query results as per the requirement.
3.    Art of Googling : I had to Google many times while completing this project.
4.    Exploring various options in MS Excel as I had to again take help of Google to get the visuals as I want.
 
Lastly, Thanks to entire codebasics team, Dhaval Patel Sir, Hemanand Vadivel sir for giving us the opportunity to explore in SQL.
